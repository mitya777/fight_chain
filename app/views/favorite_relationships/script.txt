Intro

	Hi guys, thank you for taking time out of your busy day to check out fightchain.com. 

	My name is Dmitriy Fabrikant.
	I'm a black belt under Roberto Maia and I've been training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for about eight years.

	In that time, to improve, I've watched a lot of video of techniques on youtube.

	As most of you know though, effective jiu jitsu is not about executing one technique at a time, but chaining techniques together until you force your opponent into a mistake.

	I built this tool to organize the videos of techniques I watched in the same way that I would chain them together while rolling.

	Let me show you a simple example to demonstrate.

	One of the first technique chains I learned was armbar from closed guard, to triangle, to omoplata.


	<go through chain>

	You can see the armbar being demonstrated here. 

	It would be great if after watching this armbar video we could be reminded of what the next move in the chain is and watch a video of that.

	You can do that here under "Chain Forwards"

	This is a nice reference for watching a video of whatever technique I am working on, the techniques which lead up to that, as well as seeing which moves I can move on to, to keep my opponent on the defense.


	Let me show you how these videos got here by chaining an omoplata SWEEP on to this omoplata submission.

	Now let's go find another technique to insert into my game.

	This is just a prototype on top of which I will be making lots of improvements hopeuflly with your feedback.

	Let me know what you think at fightchain@gmail.com
